After graduating from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2017 with a B.S. in Environmental Studies I worked in both field and research postitons for 2 years and travelled intermittently to southeast Asia before returning to school. I worked as a researcher on two U.S Forest Service and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation projects in the Carla D'Antonio Ecology lab. One project compared remote sensing estimates to ground-truthing estimates of post-fire recovery of chaparral, oaks, and conifers. The second project, which is on-going, aims to improve outplanting success of the endemic conifer *Pseudotsuga macrocarpa*. After witnessing large areas of preiously forested habitat lacking regeneration 10 years after a severe wildfire, I was inspired to continue my education to help preserve natural resources for future generations. I am specializing in Conservation Planning with a focus in Envrionmental Data Science. Due to my previous work with conifers and future intentions to continue working in forest ecosystems, I was awarded a Forest and Sustainability Fellowship. As a student, I am continuing to contribute to my passion for forest conservation through continued work on endemic Big-Cone conservation in the Carla D'Antonio Lab and new work on wildland urban interface (WUI) in the Max Moritz Fire Ecology Lab. While at Bren, I want to better understand the socio-economic factors that contribute to solving environmental problems related to resource management and sustainability. In the future, I hope to work as an assistant land manager for a UC Nature Reserve of for a federal agency like the USFS, NPS, or USFWS.
