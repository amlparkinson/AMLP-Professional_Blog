# Background 

My masters group project at the Bren School or Environmental Science & Management aims to understand the natural range of variation (NRV) of historic yellow pine mixed conifer (YPMC) forests in southern California and compare those conditions to current forests to determine how forest structure has changed over the past 90+ years. YPMCs are the most abundant forest type in southern California, yet there is no compiled NRV for these forests in the study area. This information is essential for forest managers like the U.S. Forest Service to better understand the health of the forests and to conduct forest health projects. We are also making a species distribution model to determine suitable habitat for Jeffrey pines (*Pinus jeffreyi*) in the future under several different climate and emissions scenarios. You can learn more about the project [here](http://www.gotforestry.com/). The expected completion date of the project is Mid to late March 2021.
