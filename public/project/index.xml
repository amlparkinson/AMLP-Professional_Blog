&lt;p&gt;Capture-recapture studies were carried out in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest in Alaska to monitor populations of a keystone prey species, the snowshoe hare (&lt;em&gt;Lepus americanus&lt;/em&gt;)^1^.Studies have taken place in five locations in the Tanana Valley since 1998, however available data only includes information from  1998 - 2012 (Figure 1). Data such as sex, age, and weight were documented. For more information on collection methods and spatial information, please see the

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My masters group project at the Bren School or Environmental Science &amp;amp; Management aims to understand the natural range of variation (NRV) of historic yellow pine mixed conifer (YPMC) forests in southern California and compare those conditions to current forests to determine how forest structure has changed over the past 90+ years. YPMCs are the most abundant forest type in southern California, yet there is no compiled NRV for these forests in the study area. This information is essential for forest managers like the U.S. Forest Service to better understand the health of the forests and to conduct forest health projects. We are also making a species distribution model to determine suitable habitat for Jeffrey pines (&lt;em&gt;Pinus jeffreyi&lt;/em&gt;) in the future under several different climate and emissions scenarios. You can learn more about the project 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gotforestry.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The expected completion date of the project is Mid to late March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NPS Oakwoodland Drought Analysis</title>
      <link>/project/nps-oak-internship/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/nps-oak-internship/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a summer internship (2020) with the Future Park Leaders of Emerging Change (FPL), currently known as Scientists in Parks, I worked with the NPS at Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SAMO) to understand the extent of oak dieback caused during the 2011-2018 California mega drought. This was the most severe drought in 1,200 years (1) and resulted in the loss of over 129 million trees across the state (2). The goals of the internship were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the best method to identity drought induced oak dieback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine where dieback has likly occured across the park&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assessed several different remote sensing approaches and determined that using the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) with 30m Landsat imagery was the best method to monitor drought dieback. Landsat was the highest resolution imagery that was free and available both before and throughout the drought. However, I hypothesize higher resolution imagery will be better for this analysis since there will be less heterogeneity within pixels. EVI is an index that essentially quantifies vegetation greenness. EVI is easy to calculate and robust compared to similar indices. There are much more advanced techniques to monitor drought, but EVI is the simplest approach and would be easily reproducible in the future by NPS staff at SAMO with little to no remote sensing or coding experience. However, a drawback of EVI is all vegetation is green. Meaning there can be overlap with other vegetation that grows in or around oaks (Figure 1). While oak stands have been mapped within the park, their boundaries contain other vegetation. Thus, using EVI results in a lot of overlap with pixels dominated by other vegetation types. To overcome this issue I had to take an extra step to ensure the pixels being analyzed were actually oaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;veg_overlap.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Annual grasses and coastal sage scrub grows within the boundary of a mapped oak woodland polygon. The red boxes indicate the boundary of a 30m landsat pixel and demonstrate the overlap of other vegetation growing in the understory of the oaks which can influence the EVI values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-step threshold was used to remove non-oak dominated pixels (Figure 2), which were pixels with less than 50% oaks. The first step removed pixels with EVI &amp;lt; 0.18, which resulted in high oak classification accuracy, but also high misclassification of other vegetation as oaks. The seocond step took advantage of the rapid increase in EVI between October and December, which is likely due to annuals like annual grass quickly taking advantage of rainfall. Pixels with EVI &amp;gt; 0.115 were also removed. The two step approach resulted in a slightly lower oak classification accuracy from 89% to 85%, but greatly reduced the misclassification of other vegetation as oaks from 52% to just 39%. Oak pixels burned in a fire between 2005-2016 were also removed to avoid confusion between drought and fire induced canopy dieback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pixel_removal_threshold.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Visual representation of the two thresholds. Oaks, in pink, are oak dominated pixels (&amp;gt;50% of the pixel is covered with oaks).Other + Some Oak, in blue, are pixels dominated by other vegetation but contain some oaks (&amp;lt;50%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I used a Z score ((EVI year - EVI baseline)/standard deviation baseline) to assess the effect of drought on oaks (Figure 3). This method compares average summer (August, September, October) EVI during the drought to a pre-drought baseline (2000-2004). Most oaks with dieback experienced notable decrease in EVI 3 years into the drought after 2014. But oaks with no dieback did not have noticeable loss in EVI until 7 years into the drought in 2018 and they had a much larger increase in EVI after the drought in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pixel_removal_threshold.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Trends of EVI Z scores for pixels classified as having high or no dieback. The dashed line at 0 is the baseline value. Values above 0 represent an increase in EVI compared to baseline, and values less than 0 represent a decrease in EVI compared to baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A binomial logistic regression using 2016 Z scores was used to determine a threshold for classifying dieback. Between 2,053-3,466 acres (45.6-77%) of oaks have a 95-55% probability, respectively, of experiencing high canopy dieback (Figure 4). However, this is likely an overestimate as visual comparisons in Google Earth did not verify these results. While many oak stands had some level of canoy dieback, not most did not have high dieback, which was defined as &amp;gt; 80% canopy loss. Future work should aim to adjust the model in order to quantify varying degrees of canopy dieback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;dieback.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Oaks with a 95% probability of dieback. Red = pixels with high dieback, green = pixels with no dieback, and grey = removed pixels. Note, the maps at this scale may be a little misleading since there are many pixels being plotted, so some may be hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One enlightening aspects of the projects were the results of qualitiative field surveys. COVID-19 did not allow for extensive field work, but a quick assessement showed that approxmately 80% of oaks that suffered high canopy dieback during the drought exhibited canopy regrowth (Figure 5). Even oaks that burned severely during the drought were showing signs of recovery. This just goes to show how fire and drought tolerant oaks really are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a project  to understand how topographic and climatic variables affected mortality of endemic Big-cone (&lt;em&gt;Pseudotsuga macrocarpa&lt;/em&gt;) conifers in Los Padres National Forest after the 2007 Zaca Fire. Knowing how these variables interact to affect fire-induced mortality will help guide restoration efforts by prioritizing out-planting in areas most likely to survive future fires. ArcGIS was used to gather mean values for topographic variables such as elevation, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), and topographic position index (TPI) and climate variables; weather data was obtained as 30-year normals from the PRISM Climate Group (1).  Here I will be exploring relationships between these environmental variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;h1 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temperature (i.e. mean maximum August temperature),VPD (August), and climatic water deficit (CWD) have a very strong positive relationship with each other and a very strong negative relationship with annual precipitation. Both CWD and VPD depend on available water in the ecosystem. Thus, this strong trend is not surprising considering that one of the hottest months of the year in which there likely has not been rainfall in months is correlated with high VPD and high CWD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation has a strong negative relationship with temperature, VPD (August and January), and CWD, yet a moderate positive relationship with annua precipitation. As elevation increase, temperatures cool which would in turn redcude VPD and CWD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slope has a very strong negative relationship with flow accumulation and topographic wetness index (TWI). Slope is a component used to calculate TWI (2). High values of TWI and flow accumulation (where water accumulates) indicate wetter areas. A decrease in slope would be associated with higher TWI and flow accumulation values.&lt;/li&gt;
