I worked as a researcher on two U.S Forest Service and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation projects in the Carla D'Antonio Ecology lab. One project compared remote sensing estimates to ground-truthing estimates of post-fire recovery of chaparral, oaks, and conifers. The second project, which is on-going, aims to improve outplanting success of the endemic conifer Pseudotsuga macrocarpa. After witnessing large areas of preiously forested habitat lacking regeneration 10 years after a severe wildfire, I was inspired to continue my education to help preserve natural resources for future generations. I am specializing in Conservation Planning with a focus in Envrionmental Data Science. Due to my previous work with conifers and future intentions to continue working in forest ecosystems, I was awarded a Forest and Sustainability Fellowship. As a student, I am continuing to contribute to my passion for forest conservation through continued work on endemic Big-Cone conservation in the Carla D'Antonio Lab and new work on wildland urban interface (WUI) in the Max Moritz Fire Ecology Lab. While at Bren, I want to better understand the socio-economic factors that contribute to solving environmental problems related to resource management and sustainability. In the future, I hope to work as an assistant land manager for a UC Nature Reserve of for a federal agency like the USFS, NPS, or USFWS.\n","date":1576022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1576022400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"After graduating from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2017 with a B.S. in Environmental Studies I worked in both field and research postitons for 2 years and travelled intermittently to southeast Asia before returning to school.

As a result, the sources of variability in post-disturbance recovery trajectories are poorly understood. In this study, we monitored the recovery of chaparral and conifer species following the 2007 Zaca Fire, which burned 97,270 ha in Santa Barbara County, California. We combined field survey data with two time series remote sensing products: the relative delta normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) and green vegetation (GV) fractions derived from spectral mixture analysis. Recovery trajectories were retrieved for stands dominated by six different chaparral species. We also retrieved recovery trajectories for stands of mixed conifer forest. We found that the two remote sensing products were equally effective at mapping vegetation cover across the burn scar. The GV fractions (r(78) = 0.552, p \u0026lt; 0.001) and normalized burn ratio (r(78) = 0.555, p \u0026lt; 0.001) had nearly identical correlations with ground reference data of green vegetation cover. Recovery of the chaparral species was substantially affected by the 2011–2017 California drought. GV fractions for the chaparral species generally declined between 2011 and 2016. Physiological responses to fire and drought were important sources of variability between the species. The conifer stands did not exhibit a drought signal that was directly correlated with annual precipitation, but the drought likely delayed the return to pre-fire conditions. As of 2018, 545 of the 756 conifer stands had not recovered to their pre-fire GV fractions. Spatial and temporal variation in species composition were important sources of spectral variability in the chaparral and conifer stands. The chaparral stands in particular had highly heterogeneous species composition. Dominant species accounted for between 30% and 53% of the land cover in the surveyed chaparral patches, so non-dominant land cover types strongly influenced remote sensing signals. Our study reveals that prolonged drought can delay or alter the post-fire recovery of Mediterranean ecosystems. It is also the first study to critically examine how fine-scale variability in land cover affects time series remote sensing analyses.\n","date":1576022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576022400,"objectID":"966884cc0d8ac9e31fab966c4534e973","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/","publishdate":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/","section":"publication","summary":"Combination of remote sensing with field surveys to assess the post-fire recovery of chaparral and conifers 10 years after the Zaca Fire.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Monitoring Post-Fire Recovery of Chaparral and Conifer Species Using Field Surveys and Landsat Time Series","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

YPMCs are the most abundant forest type in southern California, yet there is no compiled NRV for these forests in the study area. This information is essential for forest managers like the U.S. Forest Service to better understand the health of the forests and to conduct forest health projects. We are also making a species distribution model to determine suitable habitat for Jeffrey pines (Pinus jeffreyi) in the future under several different climate and emissions scenarios.

This was the most severe drought in 1,200 years (1) and resulted in the loss of over 129 million trees across the state (2). The goals of the internship were:\n Determine the best method to identity drought induced oak dieback Determine where dieback has likly occured across the park  Results I assessed several different remote sensing approaches and determined that using the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) with 30m Landsat imagery was the best method to monitor drought dieback. Landsat was the highest resolution imagery that was free and available both before and throughout the drought. However, I hypothesize higher resolution imagery will be better for this analysis since there will be less heterogeneity within pixels. EVI is an index that essentially quantifies vegetation greenness. EVI is easy to calculate and robust compared to similar indices. There are much more advanced techniques to monitor drought, but EVI is the simplest approach and would be easily reproducible in the future by NPS staff at SAMO with little to no remote sensing or coding experience. However, a drawback of EVI is all vegetation is green. Meaning there can be overlap with other vegetation that grows in or around oaks (Figure 1). While oak stands have been mapped within the park, their boundaries contain other vegetation. Thus, using EVI results in a lot of overlap with pixels dominated by other vegetation types. To overcome this issue I had to take an extra step to ensure the pixels being analyzed were actually oaks.\n\rFigure 1: Annual grasses and coastal sage scrub grows within the boundary of a mapped oak woodland polygon. The red boxes indicate the boundary of a 30m landsat pixel and demonstrate the overlap of other vegetation growing in the understory of the oaks which can influence the EVI values.\nA two-step threshold was used to remove non-oak dominated pixels (Figure 2), which were pixels with less than 50% oaks. The first step removed pixels with EVI \u0026lt; 0.18, which resulted in high oak classification accuracy, but also high misclassification of other vegetation as oaks. The seocond step took advantage of the rapid increase in EVI between October and December, which is likely due to annuals like annual grass quickly taking advantage of rainfall. Pixels with EVI \u0026gt; 0.115 were also removed. The two step approach resulted in a slightly lower oak classification accuracy from 89% to 85%, but greatly reduced the misclassification of other vegetation as oaks from 52% to just 39%. Oak pixels burned in a fire between 2005-2016 were also removed to avoid confusion between drought and fire induced canopy dieback.\n\rFigure 2: Visual representation of the two thresholds. Oaks, in pink, are oak dominated pixels (\u0026gt;50% of the pixel is covered with oaks).Other + Some Oak, in blue, are pixels dominated by other vegetation but contain some oaks (\u0026lt;50%).\nI used a Z score ((EVI year - EVI baseline)/standard deviation baseline) to assess the effect of drought on oaks (Figure 3). This method compares average summer (August, September, October) EVI during the drought to a pre-drought baseline (2000-2004). Most oaks with dieback experienced notable decrease in EVI 3 years into the drought after 2014. But oaks with no dieback did not have noticeable loss in EVI until 7 years into the drought in 2018 and they had a much larger increase in EVI after the drought in 2019.\n\rFigure 3: Trends of EVI Z scores for pixels classified as having high or no dieback. The dashed line at 0 is the baseline value. Values above 0 represent an increase in EVI compared to baseline, and values less than 0 represent a decrease in EVI compared to baseline.\nA binomial logistic regression using 2016 Z scores was used to determine a threshold for classifying dieback. Between 2,053-3,466 acres (45.6-77%) of oaks have a 95-55% probability, respectively, of experiencing high canopy dieback (Figure 4). However, this is likely an overestimate as visual comparisons in Google Earth did not verify these results. While many oak stands had some level of canoy dieback, not most did not have high dieback, which was defined as \u0026gt; 80% canopy loss. Future work should aim to adjust the model in order to quantify varying degrees of canopy dieback.\n\rFigure 4: Oaks with a 95% probability of dieback. Red = pixels with high dieback, green = pixels with no dieback, and grey = removed pixels. Note, the maps at this scale may be a little misleading since there are many pixels being plotted, so some may be hidden.\nOne enlightening aspects of the projects were the results of qualitiative field surveys. COVID-19 did not allow for extensive field work, but a quick assessement showed that approxmately 80% of oaks that suffered high canopy dieback during the drought exhibited canopy regrowth (Figure 5). Even oaks that burned severely during the drought were showing signs of recovery. This just goes to show how fire and drought tolerant oaks really are!\n\rFigure 5: Oaks that experienced high dieback recovering in summer 2020.\nTo learn more about the project, download the final report here.\nCitations  Griffin, Daniel, Anchukaitis, Kevin J. 2014.

Both CWD and VPD depend on available water in the ecosystem. Thus, this strong trend is not surprising considering that one of the hottest months of the year in which there likely has not been rainfall in months is correlated with high VPD and high CWD. Elevation has a strong negative relationship with temperature, VPD (August and January), and CWD, yet a moderate positive relationship with annua precipitation. As elevation increase, temperatures cool which would in turn redcude VPD and CWD. Slope has a very strong negative relationship with flow accumulation and topographic wetness index (TWI). Slope is a component used to calculate TWI (2). High values of TWI and flow accumulation (where water accumulates) indicate wetter areas. A decrease in slope would be associated with higher TWI and flow accumulation values.  Citations  PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University, http://prism.oregonstate.edu, created 4 Feb 2004.
